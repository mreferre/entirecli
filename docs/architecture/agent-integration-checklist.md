# Agent Integration Checklist

This document provides requirements and a checklist for integrating new AI coding agents with Entire. Use this when implementing support for a new agent (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode).

## Core Principle: Full Transcript Storage

Entire stores the **complete session transcript** at every checkpoint, not incremental diffs. This enables:

- Simple rewind: restore the full transcript, agent resumes from that state
- No dependency on previous checkpoints being intact
- Consistent behavior across all checkpoint types (committed, uncommitted)

**Each checkpoint must contain the full session history up to that point.**

## Core Principle: Native Format Preservation

Store transcripts in the **agent's native format**. Any transformation or normalization should only be done to support CLI features (rewind, resume, summarization, file extraction), not for backend or web UI consumption.

**Why:**
- The backend/web UI should handle format differences, not the CLI
- Transforming for downstream consumers couples the CLI to their requirements
- Native formats ensure compatibility with agent's own import/export tools
- Reduces risk of data loss from lossy transformations
- Format changes that break the UI can be fixed with a backend deploy; CLI changes require a full release cycle and user adoption

**Do:**
- Store the raw transcript as the agent produces it
- Parse the native format when CLI features need specific data (e.g., extract file paths for `entire status`)
- Let the backend normalize formats for display

**Don't:**
- Create a "universal transcript format" in the CLI
- Transform logs to match what the web UI expects
- Strip or restructure data to simplify backend processing

## Integration Checklist

### Transcript Capture

- [ ] **Full transcript on every turn**: At turn-end, capture the complete session transcript, not just events since the last checkpoint
- [ ] **Resumed session handling**: When a user resumes an existing session, the transcript must include all historical messages, not just new ones since the plugin/hook loaded
- [ ] **Use agent's canonical export**: Prefer the agent's native export command (e.g., `opencode export`, reading Claude's JSONL file) over manually reconstructing from events
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: If the canonical source is unavailable (e.g., agent shutting down), fall back to best-effort capture with clear documentation of limitations

### Session Storage Abstraction

- [ ] **`WriteSession` implementation**: Agent must implement `WriteSession(AgentSession)` to restore sessions
- [ ] **File-based agents** (Claude, Gemini): Write `NativeData` to `SessionRef` path
- [ ] **Database-backed agents** (OpenCode): Write `NativeData` to file, then import into native storage (the native format should be what the agent's import command expects)
- [ ] **Single format per agent**: Store only the agent's native format in `NativeData` - no separate fields for different representations of the same data

### Hook Events

- [ ] **turn-start**: Fire when user submits a prompt (for pre-prompt state capture)
- [ ] **turn-end**: Fire when agent finishes responding (for checkpoint creation)
- [ ] **session-start**: Fire when a new session begins
- [ ] **session-end**: Fire when session is explicitly ended (optional but recommended)

### Rewind/Resume Support

- [ ] **Rewind restores full state**: After rewind, agent can continue from that point with full context
- [ ] **Resume command**: `FormatResumeCommand()` returns the CLI command to resume a session
- [ ] **Session ID preservation**: Restored sessions maintain original session ID where possible

### Testing

- [ ] **New session**: Create session, multiple turns, verify full transcript at each checkpoint
- [ ] **Resumed session**: Resume existing session, add turns, verify checkpoint includes historical messages
- [ ] **Rewind**: Rewind to earlier checkpoint, verify agent can continue from that state
- [ ] **Agent shutdown**: Verify graceful handling if agent exits during checkpoint

## Agent-Specific Notes

### Claude Code
- Transcript: JSONL file on disk, always complete
- Storage: File-based, `WriteSession` just writes file
- Resume: `claude --resume <session-id>`

### Gemini CLI
- Transcript: JSON file on disk, always complete
- Storage: File-based, `WriteSession` just writes file
- Resume: `gemini --session <session-id>`

### OpenCode
- Transcript: `opencode export <session-id>` output (JSON) - this is the native format
- Storage: Database-backed, `WriteSession` writes file then imports via `opencode import`
- Resume: `opencode -s <session-id>`
- Note: Don't build transcripts from events - use `opencode export` which reads from SQLite and includes full history
